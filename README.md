## Data Files

The system creates and uses three data files in the current directory:

- **`books.txt`**: Stores information about available books in JSON format
- **`members.txt`**: Stores information about registered library members in JSON format
- **`ledger.txt`**: Logs all book issue and return transactions with timestamps

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests with coverage
make test-coverage

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_models.py -v
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Run all quality checks
make quality

# Individual tools
make format          # Format code with Black
make lint           # Run Flake8 and Pylint
make type-check     # Run mypy type checking
```

### Available Make Commands

- `make help` - Show all available commands
- `make test` - Run the test suite
- `make test-coverage` - Run tests with coverage report

## Architecture

The system is built with a modular architecture:

- **Models** (`models.py`): Define `Book` and `Member` classes with validation
- **Data Manager** (`data_manager.py`): Handle file I/O operations and data persistence
- **Library** (`library.py`): Core business logic for library operations
- **CLI** (`cli.py`): User interface and input handling

### Key Features of the Design

- **Type Hints**: Full type annotation for better code documentation and IDE support
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling with custom exception types
- **Input Validation**: Robust validation for user inputs and data integrity
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between data, business logic, and presentation
- **Testability**: Modular design enables comprehensive unit testing
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features or modify existing functionality

## Error Handling

The system includes robust error handling for:

- Invalid user inputs (empty names, titles, etc.)
- File I/O errors (permissions, disk space, etc.)
- Data corruption (malformed JSON files)
- Business logic errors (book not found, member not found, etc.)
